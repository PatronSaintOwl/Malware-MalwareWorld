System based on +500 blacklists and 5 external intelligences to detect potencially malicious hosts in internet.


## Description

The library parses more than 500 public blacklists around the internet in order to identify potencially malicious devices.

Among the final blacklist created merging all the others you can find ips, domains and urls that potencially:
-   Are infected with malware
-   Attack other hosts
-   Send spam
-   Contains phishing sites
-   Are bitcoin nodes
-   Are Tor exit nodes or web-to-tor hosts
-   Are public proxies
-   Have bad reputation
-   Are related to adware

All blacklists used to create a single and huge blacklist can be seen [here](https://malwareworld.com/textlists/blacklists.txt).

When you `require` the blacklist it will start accessing and loading all the blacklists. This process could take from 5 to 10 minutes.
The "database" will be a javascript huge dictionary in memmory. Each component will be and IP or Domain or IPRange potencially malicios that will have as atributes:
+ A title
+ An array of types (reason/s why this host is potencially malicious)
+ An array of urls (that points to the malicios part of the host)
+ Location (only filled if it is an IP) 
+ The references that have pointed to this host.

Besides, the API of 5 external intelligences are used to check single IPs or domains not only against the huge database of hosts blacklisted but also against the intelligences. If the ip or domain has something suspicious it will be discovered.

```javascript
malicious_comp = "IP/DOMAIN/RANGE": { 
                    title: "",
                    type: [],
                    urls: [],
                    location : {lat: "", lng: ""},
                    references: []
}
```

## Visual representation of a portion of the final database 

Please visit [MalwareWorld](https://malwareworld.com) to access to the main page of **MalwareWolrd** where you can check if a domain or IP is suspicious.

You can found some maps where some malicious IPs detected are represented (It is recommended to use Chrome):

+ [Hosts with bad reputation](https://malwareworld.com/badreputation)
+ [Hosts related to Malware](https://malwareworld.com/malware)
+ [Hosts known to be attacking through internet](https://malwareworld.com/attackers)
+ [Hosts sending spamm](https://malwareworld.com/spammers)
+ [Hosts related to cryptocurrencies](https://malwareworld.com/cryptocurrencies)
+ [Public proxies, tor exit nodex and tor-to-web hosts](https://malwareworld.com/hidesource)

## External Intelligences Used

By default, when you check if an IP, Domain or Url is malicious it will be checked agaist the database created merging all the blacklists and against the activated extrnal inteligences. The external intelligences are:
+ [Fraudguard](https://fraudguard.io)
+ [Fortiguard](https://fortiguard.com)
+ [ProjectHoneypot](https://www.projecthoneypot.org)
+ [Spamcop](http://spamcop.net)
+ [Web Of Trust](https://www.mywot.com)

By default, only the intelligences that don't require credentials to be used are activated. These are: **Fortiguard** and **Spamcop**.

If you want to deactivate Frotiguard or Spamcop, use:

`mw.deactivateFortiguard()`

`mw.deactivateSpamcop()`

In order to activate the other intelligences you have to set the credentials:

Activate **Fraudguard**:

`mw.setFraudguardUser("<YOUR USERNAME>");`

`mw.setFraudguardPass("<YOUR PASSWORD>");`

Activate **ProjecHoneypot**:

`mw.setProjecthoneypotKey("<YOUR API KEY>");`

Activate **WOT**:

`mw.setWOTKey("<YOUR WOT API KEY>")`

## Huge Blacklist

If you only want the huge blacklist that **MalwareWorld** creates you can access to:

+ [List of Suspicious IPs](https://malwareworld.com/textlists/suspiciousIPs.txt)
+ [List of Suspicious Domains](https://malwareworld.com/textlists/suspiciousDomains.txt)
+ [All the information about Suspicious IPs](https://malwareworld.com/textlists/ips.txt)
+ [All the information about Suspicious Domains](https://malwareworld.com/textlists/domains.txt)

## Installation

`npm install malwareworld`


## How to use

The library has been made to be as simple as possible to use.
Once the library has had time to load all the blacklists:

`const mw = require('malwareworld')`

### Check if Malicious

You can check if an IP, Domain or URL is malicious just calling:
`mw.isMalicious(<INPUT>)`

```javascript
> mw.isMalicious("70.32.94.216").then(function(result){ 
        console.log(result);
    }, function(err) {
        console.log(err);
});

// Result:
{ malicious: true,
  '70.32.94.216':
   { title: 'honeypot_tracker/Malicious Host/Spammer',
     type: [ 'Bad Reputation', 'Spammer' ],
     urls: [],
     location: { lat: 34.0202, lng: -118.3928 },
     references:
      [ 'https://fraudguard.io/',
        'https://fortiguard.com/search?q=70.32.94.216&engine=8',
        'https://www.spamcop.net/w3m?action=checkblock&ip=70.32.94.216' ] 
   }
}
```

By default this method will check the INPUT against the database created using all the blacklists and against the activated external intelligeces.

If you **don't want to create the database** using the blacklists you can do:

`mw.deactivateBlacklists()`

You can **get all the potencially malicious domains** of the database with their descriptions calling:

`mw.getMalDomainsList()`

You can **get all the potencially malicious IPs** of the database with their descriptions calling:

`mw.getMalIpsList()`

You can **get all the potencially malicious IP Ranges** of the database with their descriptions calling:

`mw.getMalRangesList()`

You can **get all the hosts of type** of the database with their descriptions calling:

`mw.getMalHostsOf(TYPE)`

```javascript
Types: BadReputation, Malware, KnownAttacker, Spammer, Phishing, CryptoCurrencies, Hidesource, Adware, DGA
```

You can **get all the blacklist that does not respond** calling:

`mw.getNotRespondingLists()`

### Statistics

You can get **general statistics** of the status of the database and the blacklists by calling:
```javascript
> mw.getGeneralStatistics()
{ num_ips: 165117,                    // Number of unique malicious IPs found
  num_domains: 118664,                // Number of unique malicious Domains found
  num_ranges: 46089,                  // Number of unique malicious IP Ranges found
  num_blacklists: 522,                // Number of blacklists used
  num_notResponding_blacklists: 0,    // Number of blacklists not loaded
  total_unique: 329870,               // Number of unique malicious hosts
  repeated: 116451,                   // Number of repetitions found between balcklists
  external_sources:                   // Check if the external sources are being used or not
   { fraudguard: false,
     fortiguard: true,
     projecthoneypot: false,
     simplespamcop: true,
     wot: false } 
}
```

You can access how much potencially malicious hosts were contained in each blacklist used and the sha1 of the response body by calling:

`mw.getStatistics()`

### Renew data

You can **reload all the blacklists** calling:

`mw.renewAllData()`

You can **reload all the not responding blacklists** calling:

`mw.renewNotRespondingData()`

You can **set an interval to reload every blacklists** calling:

`mw.renewtAllDataInterval(MINUTES)`

You can set an interval to **reload every not responding blacklists** calling:

`mw.renewNotRespondingDataInterval(MINUTES)`

### Port

You can set the `isMalicious()` function to listen in a port calling:
`mw.listenInPort(PORT)`

### Example

```javascript
const mw = require('malwareworld');

mw.setFraudguardUser("<YOUR USERNAME>");
mw.setFraudguardPass("<YOUR PASSWORD>");
mw.setProjecthoneypotKey("<YOUR API KEY>");
mw.setWOTKey("<YOUR API KEY>");

var day = 24**60;
var hour1   = 1**60;

mw.renewtAllDataInterval(day);      	  // Reload the blacklists every day
mw.renewNotRespondingData(hour1);       // Try to load the not responding blacklists every hour

mw.listenInPort(9999);                  // Expose the isMalicious() funtion in port 9999  

mw.isMalicious("malwareworld.com").then(function(result){  // Check if the domain malwareworld.com is malicious (No, it isn't)
        console.log(result);
    }, function(err) {
        console.log(err);
});

```


## TODO
-   Integrate more blacklists and external intelligences.
-   If you know about blacklists or external intelligences that are not used, please contact me.
